# AI Ethics Evaluator - System Overview

## What is this system?
The **AI Ethics Evaluator** is an automated auditing tool designed to screen documents (PDFs and Images) for compliance with the **2021 UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence**.

Unlike standard plagiarism checkers, this system provides a **"Dual-Layer Analysis"**: it evaluates both the **Integrity** (Origin) and the **Morality** (Content) of the document simultaneously.

## How it Works (The Scan Process)

The system operates in a streamlined 4-step process:

### 1. Ingestion & Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
*   **Input**: The user drags and drops a file (Research Paper, Proposal, Policy Document).
*   **Processing**:
    *   If it's a **PDF**: The system extracts raw text structure.
    *   If it's an **Image**: It uses AI Vision (Tesseract) to "read" the text inside the image.

### 2. Path A: The Integrity Engine (Winston AI)
*   **Goal**: Determine *who* wrote the content and *where* it came from.
*   **AI Detection**: Analyzes linguistic patterns (burstiness and perplexity) to calculate the probability that the text was generated by an AI model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
*   **Plagiarism Search**: Scans billions of web pages to ensure the content is original.
*   **Smart Fallback**: If the system detects low API credits or connection issues, it employs a smart truncation algorithm—analyzing the most critical sections of the text to ensure a verified result is always returned.

### 3. Path B: The Ethics Engine (Google Gemini)
*   **Goal**: Determine *if* the content is ethical.
*   **Reasoning Model**: The text is sent to Google's advanced **Gemini Flash Thinking Model**.
*   **UNESCO Framework**: The AI assumes the persona of an "Ethics Auditor" using a custom **Filipino-First System Prompt**. It critiques the document across 11 specific dimensions:
    1.  **Human Rights** (Karapatang Pantao)
    2.  **Do No Harm** (Huwag Manakit)
    3.  **Fairness** (Katarungan)
    4.  **Privacy** (Pribasiya)
    5.  **Transparency** (Transparensya)
    6.  **Human Oversight** (Pananagutan)
    7.  **Safety** (Kaligtasan)
    8.  **Sustainability** (Kalikasan)
    9.  **Inclusiveness** (Pagsasama)
    10. **AI Literacy** (Kamalayan)
    11. **Governance** (Pamamahala)

### 4. The Dashboard (Result)
*   The system aggregates findings from both engines into a unified **Glassmorphic Dashboard**.
*   **Scoring**: It does not just say "Pass/Fail". It provides a weighted score (0-10) with detailed qualitative feedback in Filipino, helping the user understand *why* a score was given.

## Why this matters?
Most tools only check for plagiarism. This tool checks for **Alignment with Human Values**. It ensures that AI technologies being proposed or reviewed are not just *original*, but also *safe, fair, and sustainable* for Philippine society.
